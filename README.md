# Complexity Classes via Computer Games

## About 
- The purpose of the project, **Complexity Classes via Computer Games,** is to familiarise the
_**Complexity Classes of NP and P Time Verification**_ by implementing various problems in each 
of these classes as part of a computer game.

## Aim
- Gamification of complexity classes.
- Invite a new audience to computational complexity and intractability.
- To play through instances of problems in Classes P and NP.

## Objectives
- Introduce a gamified platform for learning complexity classes P and NP.
- Engaging and graphical.
- Show the difference between problems that can be solved easily(P) and ones that can be verified easily(NP).

## Mini Games
## Class P 
This mini game provides a introduction to Polynomial time solvable class of problems.

## Class NP
- We have included the **Vertex Cover problem, the Santa-Claus problem, the Set Cover problem**. In 
particular, the gamification process of the complexity classes is done by incorporating them as puzzles
and mini-games, thereby allowing the users to form a clear understanding of the concepts behind 
these classes.

## P time Verification
- These mini games show us how how verifition of NP Class instance when given a Certificate of that instance is easier than solving the NP Class problem.
